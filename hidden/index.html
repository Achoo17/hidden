    <h2>For you,</h2>

    <p>Hey there! Long-distance fiance. Just wanted to write you something small and quick because why not.

        It's just that I like you more everyday. It's you I think of when I wake up in the morning 
        - sometimes something specific you said that was funny or sweet, 
        sometimes just your cute monkey like face. You make it easy to start every day because I know 
        I'll be able to talk to you and laugh with you.

         They say absence makes the heart grow fonder, but all it's doing for me is turning me into a professional daydreamer
        starring you as the main character. I'm practically a director now. Tee hee :)

        I really miss you very much. I looked up 'how to teleport' online, but all I found were conspiracy
        theories and a DIY teleportation kit that seemed a bit sketchy. Until then, I'll just keep sending 
        you virtual hugs and kisses through the magic of technology. Toodles!</p>
